# UI_Autotests_for_Habr_Career
Wrote UI autotests for the site https://habr.com/, namely:
1) Made a list of 5 smoke tests for myself and automated these steps
2) For each test I marked the marking as “@pytest.mark.smoke”
3) I searched for elements only using XPATH
4) Connected Allure for clearer reporting of autotests, which can be viewed in the test_results folder:

5) I tried to write all the names of functions, classes and locators meaningfully for easier comprehension
